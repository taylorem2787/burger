# hawaiian-burger
Created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
